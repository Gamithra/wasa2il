<!--
This is the most basic example possible using the customDialogSelector setting. It is entirely unstyled by default since you're probably using a custom dialog so that you can style it according to your website.

You may uncomment and customize the controls below according to your needs. If they are left uncommented, then they will be automatically generated for you with default values. In other words, this dialog should work out of the box without any modification, although the default text provided below is probably not what you want on a production website.
-->
<div id="cookie-dialog" style="display: none;">
<div id="cookiesdirective">

This is a custom message for your website, to notify your users that you use cookies. When using a custom dialog like this one, you are not required to provide a privacy policy URI when initializing cookiesDirective, since you can put anything you want in here.

<!-- These controls are needed if you require explicit consent. -->
<!--
<span id="epdnotick"><strong>Please accept!</strong></span>
<input type="checkbox" id="epdagree" />
<input type="submit" id="explicitsubmit" value="Continue" />

<!-- This control is needed if you only need implied consent. -->
<!--
<input type="submit" id="impliedsubmit" value="Do not show this message again" />
